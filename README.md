This mod will patch your SystemUI with xmls (or smali, resources,etc) which you place under the folder substratumXML. 
Tested from A9-A13, will probably work fine for older and newer android versions. 

Just flash in magisk and reboot.

Features-
Quick Installation
Small size
Supports custom Functions
Multiple Modules work together without issues

How to use multiple mods together?

-Flash any 1 module 
-Reboot
-Flash another
Both will merge automatically and work together

Alternatively you can merge manually by adding all xml into substratumXML folder

Edit module prop and enter you module id name and description accordingly.
