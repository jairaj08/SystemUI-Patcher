All roms are supported, including aosp, miui, oneui, oos, etc. If it doesn't work for you then report @cool_modules69 on telegram to add support.

This mod will patch your SystemUI with xmls (or smali, resources etc.) which you place under the folder SystemUI.
Tested from A9-A13, will probably work fine for older and newer android versions.

Just flash in magisk and reboot.

### Features:

- Quick Installation

- Small size

- Supports custom Functions

- Multiple Modules work together without issues

### How to use multiple mods together?

- Flash any 1 module

- Reboot

- Flash another

- Both will merge automatically and work together

Alternatively you can merge manually by adding all XML into SystemUI folder.

Edit module.prop and enter you module id name and description accordingly.
